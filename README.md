 # CA400 Final Year Group Project - ICE

ICE is a cross platform mobile application for both Android and IOS devices, built through the React Native framework. It provides users with a sense of reassurance that they can remain safe through their phone. It contains multiple functionality which would assist users in the circumstance where they may feel uneasy or in danger. As while we have many uses for our smartphone devices, one thing that it could have great purpose for is personal safety. This is where our application comes into use, providing that reassurance and extra comfort for those within today's society, through your own phone.
